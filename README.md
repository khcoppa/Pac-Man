# Pac-Man Browser Game

## Description

  * Pac-Man is a classic 1-Player arcade game where the player controls Pac-Man
  through a maze of Pac-Dots. Pac-Man must consume all the Pac-Dots on the map
  without touching any colored-ghosts. Flashing Pac-Dots near the corners of the
  maze change the ghost's speed and color and allow Pac-Man to temporarily consume them. The ghosts regenerate in the center box.
